    overview: `GOA BUILDATHON ’27 is a 36-hour offline hackathon planned for January 2027 in Goa, India. It aims to bring together developers, designers, AI enthusiasts, problem-solvers and innovators from colleges and communities to turn ideas into working solutions.

This is where ideas move beyond discussions and become prototypes. Whether you're exploring AI agents, developing web applications, automating everyday workflows or experimenting with emerging technologies, GOA BUILDATHON ’27 is designed to give you the space to build, collaborate and challenge yourself.

Our vision is to create an environment where students can experiment with new technologies, solve meaningful problems, learn from experienced builders and connect with people who share the same passion for creating.

Not just another hackathon. A place to turn ideas into reality.

What To Expect:
• 36 hours of offline building in Goa
• Collaboration with developers, designers and innovators
• Hands-on experimentation with AI, AI agents and automation
• Web development, software engineering and emerging technology
• Teamwork, rapid prototyping and practical problem-solving
• Opportunities to connect with mentors, judges and technology communities
• Project showcases and opportunities to present your ideas
• Community partnerships and potential sponsor-led challenges
• An environment focused on learning, creativity and building real solutions

Who Can Participate?:
GOA BUILDATHON ’27 welcomes students, aspiring developers, designers, AI builders and technology enthusiasts who want to learn by building. Whether you're an experienced hackathon participant or attending your first hackathon, the focus is on curiosity, collaboration and the willingness to create something meaningful. Bring your skills, find teammates, explore unfamiliar technologies and turn your ideas into something people can experience.

What Can You Build?:
• Artificial Intelligence & AI Agents: Build intelligent assistants, agentic workflows and practical AI-powered applications.
• Web Development: Create websites, platforms and full-stack applications that address real problems.
• Automation: Develop tools that reduce repetitive work and improve everyday processes.
• Data Science & Analytics: Turn data into insights, useful tools and better decisions.
• Software & Developer Tools: Build products that improve workflows, productivity and collaboration.
• Electronics & Emerging Technology: Explore innovative solutions that connect software with the physical world.

The goal is not simply to present an idea, but to make meaningful progress towards a working solution within the hackathon.

Why Goa?:
Goa offers a distinctive setting for bringing people together to learn, collaborate and create. GOA BUILDATHON ’27 aims to combine the energy of a technology-building event with a community-driven experience where new connections and ideas can grow. We want participants to leave with more than a project: new skills, valuable connections, practical experience and the confidence to keep building.
